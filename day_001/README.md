<h1>Day 001</h1>

Today was an introduction to variables (named storage locations), strings (ordered sequences of characters) and inputs (interaction with users).

The project for the day was a band name generator. For this you needed to get the user's birth city and pet name as inputs. These were then concatenated to make a band name which was printed to the user.
